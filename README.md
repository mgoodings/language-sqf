# Sqf language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting and completions to Sqf files in Atom.

Originally [converted](http://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle)
from the [Sublime-SQF-Language Package](https://github.com/JonBons/Sublime-SQF-Language).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
